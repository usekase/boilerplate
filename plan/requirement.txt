Requirement -
Lets build a boilerplate for next js app with a base project structure and some claude code slash commands.

Background context - 

I will be starting a workshop on Learn Web development using AI (specifically claude code).
Participants will be be non technical background and it will be their first ahnds-on experience in developing web apps.
The worshop is for 6 hours hands-on experience where users will come up with an idea and use Claude code to ideate, refine the plan and start building the application.
It will be a simple application (mostly UI) with optional integrations to supabase, Clerk.
End of the workshop - each participant will have their app deployed in the vercel.

What do we want now - 

To have a boilerplate next.js app which can be as base for the participants to develop their app on top of it.
This is critical as most participants are non-technical and this boilerplate should act as a guide for them with outof box integration of tailwind, nextjs, a landing page and modules like clerk and supabase.
Participants are expected to clone this project and start refining their app idea with claude code and build on top of this. 
Boilerplate should be neatly structured and follow the principles of next.js. 
include a claude.md file
define a .env.sample file 
make sure to include enough comments at the beginning of each file

also include the following - 
.claude folder with 
slash commands like - push to github
mcp - add supabase mcp
