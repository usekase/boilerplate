## Push to GitHub

Please help me commit and push my changes to GitHub.

1. First, run `git status` to see what files have changed
2. Show me a brief summary of the changes
3. Stage all changes with `git add .`
4. Create a commit with this message: $ARGUMENTS
   - If no message was provided, suggest an appropriate commit message based on the changes
5. Push to the current branch with `git push`

If this is a new repository without a remote, help me:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (guide me through the process)
2. Add the remote origin
3. Push the code

If there are any issues (merge conflicts, authentication problems), explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
